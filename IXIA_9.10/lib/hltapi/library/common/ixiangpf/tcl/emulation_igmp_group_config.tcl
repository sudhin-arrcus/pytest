#
# Arguments:
#    -mode
#        This option defines the action to be taken.
#x   -return_detailed_handles
#x       This argument determines if individual interface, session or router handles are returned by the current command.
#x       This applies only to the command on which it is specified.
#x       Setting this to 0 means that only NGPF-specific protocol stack handles will be returned. This will significantly
#x       decrease the size of command results and speed up script execution.
#x       The default is 0, meaning only protocol stack handles will be returned.
#n   -g_enable_packing
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#x   -g_filter_mode
#x       Cofigure IGMPv3 Include Filter Mode. This is valid only for IxTclNetwork API.
#x       If this parameter is not provided, the filter_mode that was set at host level will be used instead.
#n   -g_max_groups_per_pkts
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#n   -g_max_sources_per_group
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#    -group_pool_handle
#        Groups to be linked to the session in create mode. Parameter -group_pool_handle can be provided in two ways.
#        <p>
#        <ol>
#        <li> This parameter should be provided with a multicast group handle or a list of multicast group handles retrieved after calling emulation_multicast_group_config. Multiple handles can be used only for Legacy NGPF, when port_handle is given as argument to the current command.</li>
#        <li>This parameter should be provided with one element or a list of elements in the following format: (group IP)/(group IP step)/(group count). Eg: 50.0.1.2/0.0.0.1/3. Valid only when port_handle is given as an argument - Legacy NGPF. </li>
#        </ol>
#        </p>
#    -handle
#        Group membership handle that associates group pools with an IGMP
#        session. If modify mode, membership handle must be used in conjunction
#        with session handle to identify the multicast group pools.
#x   -no_of_grp_ranges
#x       Number of igmp multicast groups in group pool.
#x   -no_of_src_ranges
#x       Number of igmp unicast sources in source pool.
#n   -no_write
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#x   -reset
#x       If the -mode is create and this option exists, then any existing
#x       group ranges will be deleted before creating new ones.
#    -session_handle
#        IGMP Host handle on which to configure the IGMP group ranges. There are two ways of providing this parameter.<br/>
#        1. Providing the IP address of the protocol interface that is associated with an IGMP host
#        on which to configure the IGMP group ranges. Valid for IxTclNetwork only.<br/>
#        2. Providing the IGMP host handle returned by ::ixiangpf::emulation_igmp_config. Valid for both IxTclNetwork and IxTclProtocols.
#    -source_pool_handle
#        Associate source pool(s) with group(s). Specify one or more source pool
#        handle(s) for (S,G) entries. None for (*,G) entries. There are two ways of providing -source_pool_handle. <br/>
#        1. This parameter should be provided with a multicast source handle or a list of multicast source handles
#        retrieved after callingemulation_multicast_source_config. Valid for both IxTclNetwork and IxTclProtocols.<br/>
#        2. This parameter should be provided with one element or a list of elements in the following
#        format: (source group IP)/(source group IP step)/(source group count) . <br/> Eg: 20.0.0.2/0.0.0.1/3. Valid for IxTclNetwork only.
