##Procedure Header
# Name:
#    ::ixiangpf::emulation_ospf_control
#
# Description:
#    This procedure is used to start, stop, and restart the protocol on an OSPF router. The user can also use this function to withdraw a route or an LSA handle and to control route flapping.

# Arguments:
#    -port_handle
#        A list of ports on which to control the OSPF protocol. If this option
#        is not present, the port in the handle option will be applied.
#    -handle
#        This option represents the handle the user *must* pass to the
#        "emulation_ospf_control" procedure. This option specifies
#        on which OSPF session to control. If port_handle option is present,
#        the port_handle takes precedence over port in the router handle. The
#        OSPF router handle(s) is returned by the procedure
#    -mode
#        Tells which option will be performed on the OSPF protocol.
#        Valid options are:
#        restart
#        start
#        stop
#        abort
#        restart_down
#        resume_hello
#        stop_hello
#        age_out_routes
#        readvertise_routes
#        advertise
#        withdraw
#        disconnect
#        reconnect
#x   -age_out_percent
#x       The percentage of addresses that will be aged out.
#x       This argument is ignored when mode is not age_out_routes and *must* be specified
#x       in such circumstances.

#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
#n   -advertise_lsa
#n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
