#
# Synopsis:
#    ixiangpf::ptp_over_ip_control
#        -handle  ANY
#        -action  CHOICES abort
#                 CHOICES abort_async

#                 CHOICES disconnect
#                 CHOICES sendgPtpSignaling
#
# Arguments:
#    -handle
#        A handle returned via a ::<namespace>::ptp_over_ip_config
#        command. This is the object on which the action will take place.
#    -action
#        Action to be executed. Valid choices are:
#        abort- abort all sessions on the same port with the target
#        endpoint designated by -handle. The control is
#        returned when the operation is completed.
#        abort_async- abort all sessions on the same port with the target
#        endpoint designated by -handle. The control is
#        returned immediately. The operation is executed in the background.
#        start/connect - start and/or negotiate session for the target endpoint
#        designated by -handle. Start and connect offer the same functionality.
#        stop/disconnect - stop and/or release session for the target endpoint
#        designated by -handle. Stop and disconnect offer the same functionality.
#
# Return Values:
