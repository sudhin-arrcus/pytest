#
# Arguments:
#    -mode
#        This option defines the action to be taken.
#x   -handle
#x       If -mode is create, delete, modify, enable or disable this option is required
#x       to specify the existing MLD Querier session.
#x   -version
#x       MLD Querier Version
#x   -startup_query_count
#x       The number of general query messages sent at startup.
#x   -general_query_interval
#x       General Query Interval in seconds
#x   -router_alert
#x       If true (1), enable IP Router Alert Option.
#x   -robustness_variable
#x       Defines the subnet vulnerability to lost packets. MLD can recover from robustness variable minus 1 lost MLD packets.
#x       The robustness variable should be set to a value of 2 or greater (7 being the maximum).
#x   -general_query_response_interval
#x       General Query Response Interval in milliseconds
#x   -specific_query_response_interval
#x       The maximum amount of time in seconds that the MLD Querier waits to receivea response to a Specific
#x       Query message. The default query response interval is 1000 milliseconds and must be less than the query interval.
#x       This parameter will be set (-mode create and -modify) only if discard_learned_info is not enabled.
#x   -specific_query_transmission_count
#x       Indicates the total number of specific Query messages sent every Specific Query Response Interval
#x       seconds before assuming that there is no interestedlistener for the particular group/source.
#x       This parameter will be set (-mode create and -modify) only if discard_learned_info is not enabled.
#x   -support_election
#x       Indicates whether or not the Querier participates in querier election. If disabled, then all incoming query messages are discarded.
#x   -support_older_version_host
#x       Indicates whether the Querier will comply to RFC 3376 Section 7.3.2 and RFC 3810 Section 8.3.2. If disabled, all membership reports with a version less than the current version are discarded.
#x   -support_older_version_querier
#x       Indicates whether the Querier downgrades to the lowest version of received query messages. If disabled, all query messages with a version less than the current version are discarded.
#x   -discard_learnt_info
#x       When -discard_learnt_info is 0, the emulated Querier maintains a complete record state for received
#x       reports and send queries (based on timer expiry for received groups and sources).
#x       If -discard_learnt_info is 1, the Querier does not maintain any database and only sends periodic general queries.
#x       The specific query group/source record information is not calculated based on any earlier received report, but is based only on the last received report.
#x   -active
#x       Specifies if the selected querier will be active or not.
#x   -name
#x       Name of the sppecified stack.
#x   -count
#x       Defines the number of sessions to create on the interface.
#x   -intf_ip_addr
#x       IP address of the test interface / emulated MLD Querier.
#x   -intf_ip_addr_step
#x       The IP address step between each session.
#x   -intf_prefix_len
#x       The netmask length value for the interface.
#x   -neighbor_intf_ip_addr
#x       IP address of the neighbor.
#x   -neighbor_intf_ip_addr_step
#x       The IP address step between each session.
#x   -mac_address_init
#x       The MAC address for the interface to be created.
#x   -mac_address_step
#x       The incrementing step for the MAC address of the interface to be
#x       created. Valid only when using IxNetwork Tcl API.
#x   -vlan
#x       Enables vlan on the directly connected MLD router interface.
#x       Valid options are: 0 - disable, 1 - enable.
#x       This option is valid only when -mode is create or -mode is modify
#x       and -handle is an MLD router handle.
#x       This option is available only when IxNetwork tcl API is used.
#x   -vlan_id
#x       VLAN ID for emulated router node. Valid for mode create and modify.
#x   -vlan_id_mode
#x       For multiple neighbor configuration, configures the VLAN ID mode to
#x       fixed or increment. Valid for mode create and modify.
#x   -vlan_id_step
#x       When -vlan_id_mode is set to increment, this defines the step for
#x       every VLAN. Valid for mode create.
#x       When vlan_id_step causes the vlan_id value to exceed it's maximum value the
#x       increment will be done modulo <number of possible vlan ids>.
#x       Examples: vlan_id = 4094; vlan_id_step = 2-> new vlan_id value = 0
#x       vlan_id = 4095; vlan_id_step = 11 -> new vlan_id value = 10
#x   -vlan_user_priority
#x       VLAN user priority assigned to emulated router node. Valid for mode create and modfiy.
#x   -enabled
#x       Enable/Disable Rate Control
#x   -no_of_queries_per_unit_time
#x       No. of Queries (per Time Period)
#x   -time_period
#x       Time Period
