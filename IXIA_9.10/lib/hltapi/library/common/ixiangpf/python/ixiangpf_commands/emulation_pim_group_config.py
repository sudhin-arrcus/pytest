		 Arguments:
		    -mode
		        This option defines the action to be taken. Note: modify and delete
		        options are not supported for IxTclProtocol. Valid choices are:
		        create- (default) An existing multicast group pool is associated/linked
		        with the specified PIM session.

		        clear_all - Removes all group pools from this session.
		        modify- Modifies group pools from this session.
		        enable- Enables the given item provided by -handle.
		        disable- Disables the given item provided by -handle.
		    -session_handle
		        PIM-SM session handle.
		    -group_pool_handle
		        Groups to be added beforehand through procedure
		        emulation_multicast_group_config. This parameter may be a list. If the case,
		        all other parameters that can be lists should have the same list length.
		    -source_pool_handle
		        Associate source pool(s) with the group.The source pool(s) must be
		        added beforehand through procedure emulation_multicast_source_config.
		        Specify one or more source pool handle(s) for (S,G) entries.None
		        for (*,G) entries.If one or more are specified, source-specific
		        join/prune will be enabled; otherwise it is disabled. This parameter may be a list. If the case,
		        all other parameters that can be lists should have the same list length.
		    -handle
		        Group membership handle that associates a group pool with a PIM
