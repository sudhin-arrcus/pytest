		 Arguments:
		n   -action_control
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		    -action
		        This is a mandatory argument. Used to select the task to perform.
		        Flapping is applicable for line subscriber devices only.
		n   -action_control_type
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		    -ancp_handle
		        ANCP range to start|stop ANCP emulation on. Emulation is started |
		        stopped for all ANCP ranges on port. This parameter is supported using
		        the following APIs: IxTclNetwork.
		    -ancp_subscriber
		        Used to specify the ANCP line subscriber device handle.
		n   -batch_size
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -interval
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -interval_unit
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -iteration_count
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -job_handle
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -peer_count
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		
		 Return Values:
		    $::SUCCESS | $::FAILURE Status of procedure call.
		    key:status  value:$::SUCCESS | $::FAILURE Status of procedure call.
		    When status is failure, contains more information.
		    key:log     value:When status is failure, contains more information.
