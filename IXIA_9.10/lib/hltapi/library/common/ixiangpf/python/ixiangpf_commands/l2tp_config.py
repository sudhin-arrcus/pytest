		        When using IxNetwork:
		        The domain group list is defined as:
		        { { IP_list_definition } { { domain_name } { lnsIP1index lnsIP2index
		        ... } } }.
		        Where:
		        IP_list_definition is defined as:
		        { ip_count starting_ip increment_step incremented_byte }
		        ip_count <1-65535> : the number of LNS IPs.
		        starting_ip <IPv4> : base LNS IP.

		        the domain name, and the first value to use in the
		        generated portion of the domain name. For example,
		        a wc_width of 001 will cause the generated portion
		        of the domain name to be three digits wide, with
		        the first value being 001. If the Base Name is mycompany,
		        the first generated domain name will be mycompany001.
		        The width of the generated portion is preserved when
		        values are incremented, so the next domains generated
		        will be mycompany002, mycompany003, and so forth.

		        passing to the next value - used for the name
		        substitution
		        trailing_name <STRING> : the string appended after the numerical
		        substitution part of the domain name.

		        in the IP_list_definition section.

		 Notes:
		    1) Coded versus functional specification.
		    2) Sessions might not be distributed as expected over tunnels and the number of
		    tunnels might be different from the what was requested when -mode "lac"
		    in the following particular case:
		    * -tun_distribution domain_group_map
		    * -sess_distribution next
		    * -l2tp_dst_step 0.0.0.0
		    * -num_tunnels  > 1
		    * More than 1 domains are configured in -domain_group_map
		    To avoid this use -sess_distribution "fill". If the current session or command was run with -return_detailed_handles 0 the following keys will be omitted from the command response:  handle
