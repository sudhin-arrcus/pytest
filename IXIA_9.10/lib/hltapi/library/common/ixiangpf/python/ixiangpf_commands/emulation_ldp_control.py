		 Arguments:
		    -mode
		        Operation that is been executed on the protocol. Valid choices are:
		        restart - Restart the protocol.
		        start- Start the protocol.
		        stop- Stop the protocol.
		        restart_down - Restarts the down sessions.
		        abort- Aborts the protocol.
		        resume_hello - Resumes hello message for the given LDP connected interface.
		        stop_hello - Stops hello message for the given LDP connected Interface.
		        resume_keepalive - Resumes Keepalive message for the given LDP connected interface.
		        stop_keepalive- Stop Keepalive message for the given LDP connected interface.
		        activate_LeafRange - Activate Multicast Leaf Range.
		        deactivate_LeafRange - Stop Multicast Leaf Range.
		n   -port_handle
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		x   -delay
		x       The percentage of addresses that will be aged out. This argument is ignored when mode is not age_out_routes and *must* be specified in such circumstances.
		    -handle
		        The LDP session handle to act upon.
		n   -advertise
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -flap_count
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -flap_down_time
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -flap_interval_time
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -flap_routes
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		n   -withdraw
		n       This argument defined by Cisco is not supported for NGPF implementation.
		
		 Return Values:
		    $::SUCCESS | $::FAILURE
		    key:status  value:$::SUCCESS | $::FAILURE
		    If status is failure, detailed information provided.
		    key:log     value:If status is failure, detailed information provided.
		
		 Examples:
		    See files starting with LDP_ in the Samples subdirectory.  Also see some of the L2VPN, L3VPN, MPLS, and MVPN sample files for further examples of the LDP usage.
		    See the LDP example in Appendix A, "Example APIs," for one specific example usage.
