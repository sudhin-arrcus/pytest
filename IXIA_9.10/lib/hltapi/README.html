Note: Based on the HLTSET, HLT loads different sets of APIs as described below:

- *P-Loads:
   o IxOS (tclHal API)
- *NO-Loads: 
   o IxTclNetwork (only; without IxTclHal)

The default setting for env(IXIA_VERSION) is the latest HLTSET237 value, if the 
value is not set. If the value is set to an IxOS major.minor version, then the 
largest HLTSET list that corresponds to that IxOS version is used.

For additional product compatibility information please refer to the following 
online utility. An Ixia website account is required before accessing.

<H3>IxNetwork API Notes</H3>
HLT now supports only IxTclNetwork API. To access this API, you can use 
HLTSETs *NO

<A NAME="Installation Notes">Installation Notes</A>
</H2>
<PRE>
   
<H3>Installing on HLAPI Windows</H3>
Starting with IxNetwork 7.51EA release, we recommend installing HLAPI by using the IxNetwork installer.
HLAPI can be installed by choosing the "Custom" setup type of the IxNetwork installer. From the "Custom 
Setup for Bundle Features" dialog box, the "HLTAPI" feature can be selected. Moreover, the sample 
scripts will be installed in the same way, as a feature option. If the user doesn't select the "Samples 
and Scripts" option from the dialog box, the HLAPI samples will not be installed by default.
Please refer to the "IxNetwork Getting Started Guide.pdf" file for more details.

However, in this release, the user still has the option to install HLAPI using its standalone installer, 
as it is still available. To install, simply execute HLTAPI9.10.exe.

<H3>Installing platform independent HLAPI</H3>

This release introduces a new installation mode for HLAPI on Linux systems.

The platform independent package can be installed using the IxNetwork platform independent installer.
From this release on, the IxNetwork archive will contain libraries for the corresponding HLAPI and IxOS 
applications.
Therefore, in order to access the HLAPI libraries, the user is required to uncompress the IxNetwork 
TAR/ZIP archive, in the desired location. 
The "bin" folder of each application provides scripts that launch the language interpreters used by Ixia
products. Please make sure to edit each script to point to the correct location, where the applications 
are installed on the system.
In order to use the HLAPI libraries, please run the "hlapitcl","hlapiperl" or "hlapipython" scripts, to 
open the desired interpreter and call the "package require Ixia" command (or its corresponding command 
in Perl/Python).

<H3>Native RedHat/Cent OS installers of HLAPI</H3>

Similar to the platform independent installer presented above, the native RedHat/CentOS install for
HLAPI will be incapsulated in the IxNetwork binary installer, starting with this release.
The user will be required to run the IxNetwork binary, which will install the language packages for the
Tcl, Perl and Python versions used by Ixia products, along with the actual application libraries for 
IxNetwork, HLAPI and IxOS. 
During the run of the IxNetwork installer, the user will be presented with the option to install HLAPI, 
option which is checked by default.
Please make sure to run the IxNetwork installer with "root" privileges, since the languages packages 
will always be placed under "/opt/ixia"! 
By default, the application libraries are also installed under "/opt/ixia", in which case the 
"hlapitcl","hlapiperl" and "hlapipython" scripts, mentioned in the platform independent installer 
section above, will work without modifications.
In the case in which the user selects another install path for the application libraries, he/she will 
have to edit the "bin" folder scripts as mentioned above, in the "Installing platform independent 
HLAPI", to point to the correct application libraries folders.
